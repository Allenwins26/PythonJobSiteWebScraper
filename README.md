# PythonWebScraper
The two available scripts:

webscraper_jobs.py

This web scraper fetches Python Developer job listings from the Monster Job aggregator site.
The web scraper parses throught the HTML retrieved through the website to pick out the relevant pieces of information and effectively filters the content for specific words.
The Python libraries requests and Beautiful Soup are powerful tools that are utilized for the task in this script and automated web scraping can be a solution to speed up the data collection process and vastly improve efficiency.

job_search.py

Code that is expanded as a command-line-interface app
